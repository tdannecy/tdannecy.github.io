              <p>Jul 19, 2016</p><br/>
              KanbanFlow is a personal task management website that takes your Kanban board to the next level! I’ve been using it for a few months and I absolutely love it. It has some cool features that can really improve your workflow and combines task management with time management. To sign up and get started, visit https://kanbanflow.com/ Creating and customizing a board First things first. Let’s create a new board and start putting tasks on it. At the top of the page, click the Select board box and click Create board. From this page, type in a name for your board and click Next. You can change this later, so don’t stress about it! Now, set your columns. Starting from the top, these columns will set your left-to-right workflow on your Kanban. You might want to add a “Holding” or “Waiting” column, but it really depends on your workflow. If you’re not sure about what to use, check out the book Personal Kanban: Mapping work, navigating life by Jim Benson. Click the Create board button when you’re finished. This is the main Kanban workspace. Each column will hold your tasks and you’ll be moving them from left to right as you work. One of the coolest features of KanbanFlow is the ability to track the time it takes for each task. At the end of a week, it can give you a report that helps you understand how much time you spent on each task. I use the Pomodoro method (25 minutes working, 5 minute break) to organize my time and I also use the stopwatch to track longer projects and meetings. If you want to learn more about Pomodoros, check out the Pomoro Techique website The magic starts when you create your first task. Click the plus symbol at the top of any column. From here, you can add a name and a description. We’ll talk about Labels, Color, and Responsibility later. There are two time boxes at the bottom of the Add task window. Enter the amount of time you think it will take you in the Time estimate box on the right. Leave the left box unchanged. It will update itself when you use the timer. The Dates tab at the top of the window allows you to add due dates that correspond with columns. For example, if a project is due next week, I would want to mark that down on my Kanban as in the target column “Done.” I would also want to begin working on it at a certain point, so I’ll make a due date for “In progress.” Larger tasks can be broken into smaller ones in the Subtasks tab at the top of the window. Now that you’ve got a task, you can start working! You don’t have to track your time, but the Timer at the bottom left of the page allows you to get stats on how long you’ve been working on a specific task. It’s a really cool feature that you...

              <p>Jun 24, 2016</p><br/>
              Chrome doesn’t display Burmese language characters correctly and you won’t be able to read anything on websites written in them. Both ZawGyi or unicode characters show up as blank boxes and there’s no way to change the Language or Input settings in Chrome to get them to show up. It’s been this way for 51 versions.



Luckily, the Myanmar Font Tools extension on the Chrome Web Store adds the ability to display these characters. You can also check out the Github repository if you want to compile it yourself. There’s no configuring or tweaking needed and after you’ve installed it, pages with Burmese characters will display correctly.



Honestly, I don’t know why this functionality isn’t available by default in Chrome. It’s a slight annoyance, but it should be included in the list of languages.

              <p>Jun 24, 2016</p><br/>
              I came across a blurb in a newsletter from Tallahassee NOW published in February 1980 that compares nonrenewable energy to patriarchy. It’s an interesting perspective and I don’t know much about feminist perspectives on renewable energy. I’d love to know more about this and learn what types of energy types were suppored in the feminist environmental movement.




  “ENERGY” – A Women’s Issue



  Loretta Bussiere



  The Women’s Movement has taught me that “we don’t want a piece of the pie” … “cause the pie sucks.” Our nation’s entire male intra-structure is based totally and completely on “oil”–a resource soon to run out and possible cause the third male “cock” war. Alternative Technology, also known as Appropriate Technology is a feminist technology. What do men say about solar, and about wind? They call them passive … they are renewable. This is the opposite of what is male dominated. It is job producing, it is not inflationary and best of all, it’s not controlled by men. This means that women can enter these markets without threatening men–this can be a future, an economic base of our country that we can play a role in.



  NOW needs to start following the politics of energy–both on the Federal level and in every state. When Governor Graham released his Energy Legislative package last week, Talahassee NOW or even state NOW should have taken a long hard look at it–a woman’s look.



  Women are in an obvious position to say, not, “we want a piece of the pie,” but, “we’re going to redefine the pie.” We are in the movement for economic democracy and when we win it, and we will because we have to, it’s going to be better for everybody–not just women.

              <p>May 25, 2016</p><br/>
              
  Today, more than 50 years after the October 1917 revolution, Soviet life reflects a mixture of ageless Russian culture, evolving Marxist ideology and the dynamics of modern technology. The most significant aspect of Soviet life is that it is planned, with central direction residing in the state. There is considerable pressure toward conformity, toward behaving in a socially and politically acceptable fashion. There is a relative de-emphasis of personal needs in favor of the primacy of the collective to which the individual is expected to yield.



  From birth through nursery school and all the school grades and Communist Party youth organizations, the Soviet child is reared to function as a member of the collective. Personality development and behavior change are achieved through group rewards and punishments. Individual achievements are considered in terms of their value to the collective. Membership in a collective provides identification, a sense of personal well-being, and satisfaction of material and emotional needs. It serves to socialize the Soviet child and to strengthen early acceptance of the values of adult society.



  The concept of the collective also dominates university life. Both undergraduate and graduate students are fully aware that they receive a very expensive state-subsidized education, plus cost-of-living stipends. There seems to be an understanding that this education is provided because the larger collective–the people of the Soviets–need the student’s talents and the resulting contribution he is expected to make. This is in concert with the Soviet attitude that every citizen, whether male or female, should contribute to society which, in turn, will meet his need for social security. One Soviet colleague put it this way, “I don’t have to save for a rainy day. I know I will always have a job or a pension. Medical care is free and our children will be educated without any cost to us”.

              <p>Apr 29, 2015</p><br/>
              I’m speaking about my project at this year’s 
Florida NOW State Conference in a few weeks! I’m very excited 
about this opportunity and I can’t wait to receive feedback on the 
site and the project as a whole!

I was asked to write a short bio and I thought I’d post it here:


  Tim D’Annecy was raised by a former pastor and graduated from a 
conservative Baptist high school.



  During his first semester in college, he was introduced to 
feminism by Helen Strain and began volunteering with Planned 
Parenthood of North Florida. It was through this experience that 
feminism “clicked.” Tim realized he wanted to learn more and 
went on to pursue a Master’s in Women’s Studies. Tim became 
fascinated with the history of feminism when he came across some 
old documents from Gainesville NOW. After finding more 
information about the organization in the university Special 
Collections, Tim created a collaborative website so that 
everyone could be able to access and learn from chapter 
newsletters and notes between activists in North Florida.



  This past year, Tim has been working diligently on this archival 
project and he recently presented his website to Gainesville NOW 
and the community in March. In the next few years, he hopes to 
bring his technology skills and feminist perspective and pursue 
a Master’s in Library and Information Science. He can be 
contacted at &#116;&#100;&#097;&#110;&#110;&#101;&#099;&#121;&#064;&#117;&#102;&#108;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#117; and the 
Florida NOW website is located at http://FLNOWarchive.org/.

              I wrote this paper for a course, but I’m not too happy with it. I might come back later and edit it when I have time.

              <div class="card-title">Digital humanities undergraduate course website</div>
              <p>Apr 18, 2015</p><br/>
              For one of my classes, I had to write an overview of a course website for my conceptual undergraduate class, “Introduction to Humanities Computing.” I wanted to have a site that fulfills the fundamental “ontological commitments” of Digital Humanities: openness, collaboration, collegiality and connectedness, diversity, and experimentation (Spiro 25-30). My class prioritizes digital publishing and this course site is the facilitator for this type of work. I will explain this concept further, but, simply put, I wanted this site be primarily a space where students could make their writings public and talk about their progress. The site I wish to create would have an inviting atmosphere for collaboration where all students feel connected to each other and their work is valued. Students should be able to get feedback on their work and feel comfortable giving feedback or suggesting changes, no matter how long the post is. To best explain these concepts for the site, I created a blank Wordpress and added a blog post that I wrote for one of my classes for an example. I also wrote a few generic comments and questions from students and replied to them as if I was the professor. All content in the site example is mine except the theme, which was created by the Wordpress developers. I’ll discuss a few different important parts about the site in the following sections and then I’ll conclude by talking about how this type of site could benefit the students in the near future. I’ve provided screenshots of the site and explained the general concept of what each image addresses. For the class Wordpress, I decided to use the P2 theme. This theme looks different from a traditional blog website in that it allows users to interact on the site as they would with Facebook. Where a traditional blog layout would focus on displaying only one post on each page, this layout uses a Facebook Timeline-type layout that displays everything on a (lengthy) single page. For me — and I’m sure this is the case for other students that grew up with technology — this layout is intuitive and it behaves in a way that I’m familiar with. The theme prioritizes real time communication and I chose to use this layout for my course website because it moves away from traditional static posts. In the past, I have been in classes where the site layout doesn’t do any favors in getting a conversation started online. Students write an essay in Word and copy and paste it to the blog, they click “Save,” and never look at it again. After that, they don’t care enough about their classmates’ work, so there’s no reason for them to stay on the class site. By midterms, I find that these sites become a dumping ground for class essays. Usually, the professor implements a rule that each student must make one post and comment on three different posts to receive full points — an approach and an issue that I wanted...

              I came across a revealing quote in a newsletter from 2000 by a member of the University of Florida campus NOW chapter during a reelection campaign:


  Feminism doesn’t mean “be nice,” I would like more open debate. All these appeals to sisterhood-just because you don’t agree with somebody doesn’t mean you don’t like the person. It’s a thing that we need to work out. “Be nice” - I don’t like that idea. We want to be a united front but we also don’t want to crush each other with everyone trying to be nice to everybody.

              I found an interesting poem from a woman who stepped down from her position as chapter president in 1973. Margaret Fifield writes to the members of Pensacola NOW in a letter that makes me wonder what else went on in the chapter. What led her to write this poem?


  Some feminists are like sheep
They’ll follow anybody
Just so they don’t have to lead.



  Some feminists are lambs
Being led to the slaughter
Innocently.



  Some feminists are like mules
Plodding along through the mire
Hoping everything will be O.K., tomorrow.



  Some feminists are like rabbits
So busy hopping about that they
Can not (or will not) admit what’s happening.



  Some feminists are like parrots
Talking a lot
But saying nothing that is new.



  Some feminists are like dogs
With a bone of contention
Until something more valuable comes along.



  Some feminists are like snakes
Slithering about very carefully
Always in control of themselves, and any situation.



  But the worst feminists of all
Are like poisonous snakes, destroying anyone around
Who doesn’t watch where she’s going.



  Too bad some feminists aren’t more human
Then they could read the signs
That say: “Beware of Snakes:”

              I wrote this paper as a quick update to my thesis committee. At 
this point, I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work that I have 
to do to and I need to get more organized if I’m going to finish 
strong. Not only do I have to manage my time, I may have to reframe 
the scope of the project to something a bit more reasonable. If I 
had five years, I’m sure I could do the whole collection but I 
won’t finish working through the entire collection in the time I 
have left in this master’s.

In any case, here’s an update of my work.

              I came across a funny comic in one of the newsletters from Tallahassee NOW dated February 1980. Thought I’d share it.



Transcription:


  Left: So the doctor says to me, “Why not have your uterus removed; You’re not using it, and it’ll save you a lot of trouble in the long run.”



  Right: If a man had a uterus, it would be like a landmark building, you’d need a court order to remove it.

              <p>Jan 1, 2015</p><br/>
              While working through a folder on the Florida NOW archive, I found a sketch of a few organizational charts from several different organizations in one of the newsletters dated 1978. I’m not sure if this is satirical or if “Arab” is supposed to be a joke, but I think it’s interesting to see how these feminist organizers saw the leadership structure of the women’s liberation movement.
