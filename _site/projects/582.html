<h1 id="september-20-2016">September 20, 2016</h1>
<p>The professor started the class by discussing models and modeling techniques. 
Importantly, models can include a representation for <strong>breakdowns</strong>, defined as 
“errors or failures, something that doesn’t work well as it should/could, or an 
annoyance that creates extra work. In systems analysis, our goal is to identify and 
eliminate/minimize these breakdown events.</p>

<h2 id="models">Models</h2>
<p>Alluding back to our models overview from previous classes, the professor noted that 
there are three high-level categories or types of models:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Big picture models</strong> - Brainstorming, visioning, imagining</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Work models</strong> - Processes, procedures, workflows, decisions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Content models</strong> - Representations, organizations, arrangements, presentations</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="scenario-based-design">Scenario based design</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scenario-based design tries to manage the complexity of design problem solving by 
concretization. A scenario is a concrete story about use. (Carroll, 2000 p. 22)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The professor noted that scenarios give you the opportunity to take a large, 
complicated question (like staff processes in a hospital) and narrow it down to a 
specific thing. In itself, it’s not a complete way to understand a situation, but it 
can give you a good overview about what’s happening at a specific point.</p>

<p>A scenario was compared to a <strong>play script</strong>. It’s an intersecting, messy story that 
models real life. There are transitions, different perspectives, and different issues 
that arise in the overall narrative.</p>

<p>Scenarios also allow us to explore the consequences of design decisions. We can see 
job responsibilities, procedures, resources, timing, and understand the indiviual 
parts of the system and the system as a whole.</p>

<p>The professor noted that within the scenario discussion, we need to make sure we don’t 
forget to consider <strong>transitions</strong>, where most design failures happen (between actors, 
between tasks).</p>

<p>Important components to consider in scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Settings</strong> or environments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Agents</strong> or actors</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>May include major <em>systems as actors</em>, if desired</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Actors often <em>instances of a persona</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Generally a <em>star actor</em> that is the primary focus</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Goals</strong> and objectives</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“What is the actor trying to accomplish?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sequence of <strong>actions</strong> or events</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="scenario-example">Scenario example</h3>

<p>In a physics lab, there are several parts that can be modeled easily.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Settings</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Physics lab equipment room</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Offices</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Coffee shop</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Classrooms</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actors</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Instructor</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab manager</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goals</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Item checkout for maintenance</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Item return</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Reserve items</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Audit/check usage information</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sequences of actions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="personas">Personas</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Personas can elp <strong>bring users alive</strong> (Holtzblatt, p. 181)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A persona is a <strong>one-page textual description of a typical user</strong> … an amalgam of 
elements drawn from several users who share common job roles, demographics, and user 
need characteristics. (Holtzblatt, p. 182)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was noted that in this definition, there is a prototypical construct of “students” 
or “professors” that we can list common principles that serve as <strong>classes of users</strong>. 
Again, this is a level of abstraction that, like scenarios, can help us understand 
large problems better. Personas can serve as agents or actoes in one or more scenarios, 
linking the two. In the physics lab example, the lab manager and the instructor serve 
as the personas that we can use as stand-ins for real people later on.</p>

<p>When creating personas, it’s a good idea to use a small number of major players or 
actors that represent the <strong>most common or important users of or participants in your 
system</strong>. It’s also good to consider <strong>diversity</strong> to cover all major users that may be 
related to the problem or solution.</p>

<p>The process of building/constructing personas is relatively straightforward.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Draw on data</strong> from interviews and observations</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Group the general types of users with similar profiles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Identify</strong> each persona’s goals, roles, and tasks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Write</strong> a persona defitnition</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Name the persona so that it makes sense in your model and has a real-world 
corrolary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use</strong> the persona in analysis and design</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="group-work">Group work</h2>

<p>The professor then broke the class up into groups to discuss an example situation of a 
walk-in computer help desk at a university Student Union.</p>

<h1 id="september-15-2016">September 15, 2016</h1>
<p>The professor started the class by again discussing the Project 
Description project due next class on Tuesday. Additionally, 
there will be a calendar of recommended progress. See the slides 
for this day for more information.</p>

<h2 id="project-management">Project management</h2>

<p>Previous to this class, we talked about different aspects of 
project. In today’s class, we’ll talk about the challenges with 
predicting and planning projects.</p>

<p>The professor noted that when it comes to projects, there are 
several maxims:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Planning = prediction</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time = Money</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time = Tasks + People + Resources</p>
</blockquote>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-needs-to-be-managed">What needs to be managed?</h3>

<p>The <strong>scope and goals</strong> of the project need to be set by setting 
reasonable expectations, avoiding project creep, and matching 
resources to scope.</p>

<p>The <strong>tasks</strong> also need to be defined. YOu need to figure out 
what needs to be done, decomposing larger tasks into smaller 
pieces and specific assignments, and by identifying task 
dependencies. These can be <strong>sequences</strong> (Task 1 must be 
completed before Task 2 can start) and <strong>parallels</strong> (Task 1 and 
2 are independent and can be done simultaneously.</p>

<p>THe <strong>schedule</strong> needs to be clear. The task duration and 
completion date need to be included with the milestones and 
deadlines. This also takes into account slack time and crunch 
time (critical path).</p>

<p>The <strong>people</strong> need to also be managed where you take into 
account needed skills, task assignments, working within other 
commitments, and preventing over or under utilization.</p>

<p><strong>Other resources</strong> need to be managed, including rooms, 
equipment, training facilities, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Risks</strong> also ntted to be managed and monitored. It’s crucial to 
identify these risks and communicate them with your stakeholders. 
Additionally, you need to identify champions.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong> need to be managed, namely establishing and 
clarifying deliverables. It’s important to establish and 
effectively meet the criteria set down in the initial planning 
phases. It’s also important to demonstrating a commitment to 
success.</p>

<p><strong>Budgets</strong> need to be managed, including the direct and indirect 
costs, fixed costs (ont-time costs, e.g. equipment purchasing or 
software licensing), and variable costs (vary in proportion to 
time or activity, e.g. cloud computing usage fees).</p>

<h3 id="cost-categories">Cost categories</h3>

<p>These categories are applicable to both project and operation 
budgets, including equipment, supplies, personnel, travel, system 
back up, etc. After we get these estimates, there needs to be a 
project justification for the question <strong>is it worth the 
expense?</strong> This is usually a monetary question, but also has 
qualities or intangibles that may be relevant (good will, 
reputation, staff retention) and takes into account actionable 
metrics (ROI, cost-benefit analysis and ratio of benefits to 
costs, and “bang for the buck”). Additionally, the question <strong>is 
it worth the effort?</strong> is an important question. If it does 
positvely affect the organization, there may be underlying issues 
that aren’t taken into account (opportunity cost, offset work, 
etc.)</p>

<h2 id="group-work---project-planning">Group work - Project planning</h2>
<p>The professor then broke the class up into groups to discuss 
speciifc tasks, resouces, people and create a schedule with 
milestones and deliverables for the project.</p>

<h1 id="september-13-2016">September 13, 2016</h1>
<p>The professor started the class by reminding that there is an 
assignment due in one week on September 20th. Primarily, this seems 
like a labor intensive group work project.</p>

<h2 id="contextual-interview-overview">Contextual interview overview</h2>
<p>The professor then moved to discuss contextual interviews, which 
were compared to the interviews that were taken last class where we 
asked our partners about the details of their commute. It was noted 
that in contextual interviews as framed by this class session, the 
question process is a bit more difficult.</p>

<p>For a basic framework, there are three parties: the interview, the 
interviewer, and the task at hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contextual Inquiry seeks to provide rich detail about customers 
by taking team members into the field. Once there, apprenticeship 
suggests an attitude of inquiry and learning. (B&amp;H, p. 46)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The professor noted that to have a successful contextual 
interview session, we have to see the user as the expert and the 
analyst or designers are the apprentices. “We’re here to just 
observe and learn how you do things.”</p>

<p>In some cases, however, it isn’t possible to observe directly. 
Sometimes safety, confidentiality, or physical space are limiters 
that make it difficult to get a first-hand experience. Examples 
include surgery, ambulance or rescue situations, battle, 
lawyer/client privilege interviews, etc. In situations like these, 
the best substitute includes interviewing immediately after the 
event when its fresh in someone’s mind, video tape the event with 
the user (perhaps with faces/words obscured), or increase the 
number of interviews. In these cases, you’re seeking <strong>saturation</strong> 
or the point where you’re not learning anything new. The professor 
also noted that in situations like this, an intimate relationship 
with a user can help you in the future to have greater access for 
other projects.</p>

<h2 id="principles-of-contextual-interviews">Principles of contextual interviews</h2>
<p>### Context of workplace
You have to be there to see it and understand it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An immersing first-hand experience with real examples give you a 
better understanding of the situation and can contextualize what 
the user is talking about later on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Artifacts, layout, and physical objects give you a better idea of 
how the work takes place and what is critical to the user’s work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pace of work, interruptions, and time pressures can be more 
directly observed and re-weighted depending on the situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helps you grasp intangible or unspoken factors like work culture, 
personal difficulties, and more “sticky” things that need to be 
experienced to understand.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="partnership">Partnership</h3>
<p>You and the user have to each have your own expertise and learn 
from each other.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You learn about</strong> the job, tasks, problems and breakdowns, and 
the culture and values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The user learns about</strong> what you need to learn and how to 
contribute to the project in addition to what the possibilities for 
a new system can help improve their job.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You each view the job differently</strong> - Your goal is to 
understand the current system and design a better system. The 
user’s goal is to get the work done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong> helps you both to learn and to improve 
workflows.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3>
<p>You need to interpret what you have seen</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Take individual facts, observations, and try to find patterns and 
relationships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ask questions. Suppose in the middle of a task, the user has to 
consult a colleague. Why? Clarifying or leading questions can be 
helpful in this situation and include “to check on how to do it? to 
ask permission? feedback? needed information? make plans for 
lunch?” and “why did this happen at this time in the task? where 
does this information come from? are there other needs?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="focus-your-attention-on-what-youre-seeing">Focus your attention on what you’re seeing</h3>
<p>Keep you and the user focused on the task at hand, but if you focus 
too much, you may not be open to really seeing and learning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t eliminate the possibility of learning something that is not 
directly related, but is important to understanding the problem or 
designing the news system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="be-aware">Be aware!</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be comfortable with admitting ignorance and asking questions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be aware of and beware of your assumptions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surprise is a good thing! It can lead to more research directions 
or opportunities that can lead to better situations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="interview-preparation">Interview preparation</h2>
<p>The professor noted that there are many questions and prep work 
that needs to go into the situation before interviewing people.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What</strong> do you need to learn? Setting goals helps, but surprises 
are inevitable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why</strong> is it important? Will it help you understand the problem, 
context, user needs? Will it help you design the new system?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Who</strong> can give you the information you need? It’s advised to 
start with a client contact, consider work roles and tasks, consult 
the organization’s hierarchy chart, and then schedule interviews 
with accessibility or ability to meet in mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Snowball</strong> effect. Use one interview to chain to another person 
to get information from another colleague that would normally just 
ignore your email.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the question comes up, “<strong>How many</strong> people do you 
need to talk to? It really depends on your situation. If you 
observe similarities, you’ve reached saturation, a good place to 
be. Also you have to be mindful of additional perspectives or 
stakeholders that might need to be considered including the time 
that you or others have to spend on the interviews. The goal isn’t 
to get interviews, but to get information. If they run out of time 
or information for various reasons, it’s okay to stop.</p>

<p><strong>Preparing in advance</strong> can help you better understand the problem 
definition, set clear interview goals, examine possible artifacts 
or documents to help add context to the current situation, and find 
our history or success of past projects, if possible.</p>

<p><strong>Planning</strong> will help you capture what you learn in the 
interviews. Consider having two interviewers, one to ask questions, 
one to take notes, and both to observe. Also consider what types of 
notes or diagrams you will have in the interview session. Some can 
be distracting, while others are critical to the interivew. 
Consider what tyes of sound or video recording can take place. This 
also comes with acquiring and explaining consent between the 
interviewees or clients. Along those same lines, photos that can be 
used later on can be of great benefit to your study, but need to 
have permission.</p>

<h2 id="interview-structure">Interview structure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The conventional interview</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Get acquainted</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Explain your purpose for your being there</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Allow interviewee to express ideas or opinions at the 
start</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transition</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Explain how the contextual interview works</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contextual interview itself</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wrap-up</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Summarize what you have learned, let the interviewee 
comment or correct your impressions</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Describe what happens in the next steps of the project 
(follow up, additional interviews and interviewees, snowball)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="asking-questions">Asking questions</h2>
<p>There are several different types of questions that you can ask in 
the contextual interview session.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Task related questions
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Describe the steps in the task</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Show documents or artifacts used in the task</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Location of original inforamtion and destination</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Object-related qurstions</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>What is a … - Specific clarifying questions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What do you call this … ?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Are there other things like this?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What do you do with it? What do others do with it?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What do you dislike/like about this?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Asking about relationships between people, artificatcs or 
processes, processes, definitions, information, and other 
interpretations can be very revealing and can help the interviewer 
get more information. In addition to open-eneded questions, 
restating what the interviewee has previously said can lead to more 
information. Additionally, try to fit what you’ve heard into what 
you know (or think you know). For example, “So <em>this</em> thing is 
related to <em>that</em> thing because they both <em>something</em>…” This 
helps you clarify things in your own mind and allows an opportunity 
for the user or interviewee to correct assumptions that might not 
be accurate. The professor also noted that it’s okay to interrupt 
the user if they’re trailing on or if you don’t understand 
something they’re saying. It’s a huge waste of time to let them 
continue if you don’t understand what’s going on.</p>

<h2 id="observation">Observation</h2>
<p>It’s important to look <strong>upstream</strong>, finding where the work comes 
from, what triggers or cues specific reactions. Also, 
<strong>downstream</strong> information is important to see where the work goes 
upon completion. <strong>Why</strong> and <strong>how</strong> things are done helps you 
understand side effects or reasonings behind what they do.</p>

<h2 id="after-the-interview">After the interview</h2>
<p>Thank the interviewee, use at least an hour immediately after the 
interview to review, record, and write down additional questions. 
It’s important to record your gut feelings or impressions because 
they can be easily lost. Share what you know what your team 
members, ask additional questions to the interviewee, and plan next 
steps for follow-up interviews or other avenues of research.</p>

<h2 id="other-information-gathering-techniques">Other information gathering techniques</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Focus groups</p>

      <li>
        <p>Can talk to more people than an interview</p>
      </li>

        <p>Can hear how people react to what other people say</p>
      </li>
      <li>

        <p>The professor noted these are generally rare because they 
don’t give you actionable or specific information that helps your 
research. Usually it requires follow-up.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="september-8-2016">September 8, 2016</h1>
<p>The professor started the class by reminding the students that there is an upcoming assignment that will be due within the last two weeks.</p>

<h2 id="contextual-design">Contextual design</h2>
<p>The professor then gave a definition of <strong>contextual design</strong> and 
cited the textbook definition found on page 3.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-the-expert">Who is the expert?</h3>
<p>There are several different types of expertise that are required to 
successfully analyze and manage an information system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Task/job expertise - The system users know how to accomplish the 
work that the system should support.</li>
  <li>Technical expertise - The system designers and developers know 
how to design and build systems.</li>
  <li>Managerial expertise - The managers know how to coordinate and 
prioritize multiple systems, jobs; negotiate for resources with 
upper management, understand organization’s strategic goals, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="situational-differences">Situational differences</h3>
<p>The professor then noted several things that may occur in an 
organization that can make it difficult to successfully implement 
projects.</p>

<p>The <strong>history of the organization and previous systems projects</strong> 
can sometimes make management or workers jaded about previous 
failures. They may also be deluded that past success means that the 
same plan will work in the future.</p>

<p>The <strong>organizational culture</strong> may prioritize innovation or 
tradition and the management could be hierarchical or flat 
structures or a combination, making it difficult to draw 
comparisons between organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder interests and concerns</strong> can collude your success by 
competing issues.</p>

<p><strong>Available resources</strong> may limit, including time, money, staff, 
etc.</p>

<p><strong>Nature and severity of the program</strong> can make it difficult to work 
on the issue. If a critical system must remain online consistently</p>

<p>The <strong>novelty of a problem or system</strong> could mean that the 
organization could have a bespoke system that makes it more 
difficult to troubleshoot because each situation is different and 
has the possibility of never having been faced before by anyone.</p>

<h2 id="user-centered-design">User centered design</h2>
<p>The professor noted that there are competing ideas about how users 
needs and opinions should be incorporated in to the design of the 
system. Swan’s article <em>Making place for clutter…</em> provides a 
basic overview of how to observe people working in their “clutter” 
and interviewed them afterwards. These interviews included 
questions such as, “Why did you do that?” and “What is your 
rationale for doing this?”</p>

<h3 id="interviews">Interviews</h3>
<p>Interviews are some of the most important tools that researchers 
have when coming up with a user-centered design plan. These can be 
thought of as “richly detailed qualitative accounts” or “thick 
description” as they help researchers understand what they have 
observed and can help readers understand what the informant is 
trying to convey. It is noted that there should be an 
identification and narrowing down of what is important and relevant 
to the study. To do this, it requires <strong>non-judgmental 
observation</strong> from systems analysts.</p>

<p>After the interviews are taken, there are several steps that need 
to occur to <strong>analyze and generalize</strong> the information that you’ve 
received.</p>

<h2 id="clutter">Clutter</h2>
<p>The professor then asked the class to define the term “clutter” 
found in the reading for this week. It was noted that it can be 
considered <strong>residue</strong>, or things that don’t seem to go anywhere or 
have any immediate or obvious purpose. There are some 
characteristics of physical clutter that can be thought of as 
similar to <strong>e-clutter</strong> that can be thought of as your Downloads 
folder. Items are downloaded, sometimes used only once, and then 
are never looked at again. Other “miscellaneous” folders that, in 
some cases, can be an embarrassment for users.</p>

<p>The class noted that e-clutter and physical clutter have some 
similarities, but they are markedly different in outcomes. For 
instance, physical clutter gives you a level of locational 
abstraction that e-clutter doesn’t allow. Additionally, e-clutter 
doesn’t have a built-in value on its surface without thumbnail or 
other signifying marker. You have to open it to know what it is. 
The class also noted that the nature of digital files allow you to 
stash a lot of stuff without thinking about it. When physical files 
pile up, it becomes a much bigger reminder because it can be a 
barrier.</p>

<h3 id="group-discussion">Group discussion</h3>
<p>The professor then broke the class up into groups to discuss 
symptoms and problems related to clutter that are in the workplace. 
The class noted that physical clutter in the workplace is often 
mixed with work-related material and personal documents. This 
mixture makes it sometimes more difficult to segregate and 
prioritize information that is needed in a pinch. Additionally, 
e-clutter is a huge issue in offices, particularly with Outlook, in 
that it can be very difficult to organize and keep track of 
messages coming in, particularly when working in teams or with a 
shared inbox. Other groups noted that text documents or excel 
spreadsheets get out of sync and often require a “librarian” or 
editor to piece together and merge the different files into a final 
master document. Other groups proposed that a move to centralized 
documents in the cloud with Google Drive could address these 
issues, but there are often institutional barriers (support, 
security, etc.) that make it impossible to move to something new.</p>

<h2 id="contextual-interview-exercise">Contextual interview exercise</h2>
<p>The professor then split the students up into one-on-one partners 
to practice interviewing each other for a task in which they are 
experts. Example activities include work activities or commuting to 
campus. There should be two interviews, we should learn as much as 
possible about the task, and then switch to learn something about 
the other person.</p>

<p>After the exercise, the professor noted that the most effective 
interview questions ask the responder to clarify or expand on what 
they’ve said. There’s a narrative part, but then there’s a 
clarifying stage where the interviewer gets more specific 
information about the general overview. These follow up questions 
are critical to the success of the interview, particularly if the 
interviewer is unfamiliar with the topic.</p>

<h1 id="september-1-2016">September 1, 2016</h1>
<p>The professor started the class by defining a few key terms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Components</strong> are symbols or structures that represent objects 
or concepts in the real world (e.g. shapes, words, icons)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Features</strong> are characteristics of the components (e.g. 
represented by size, color)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Relationships</strong> occur among components (e.g. time space 
authority, sending/receiving and by using layout, lines etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Assumptions</strong> are about the world being modeled. It’s important 
to note that these assumptions can be both accurate or inaccurate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="communication-functions">Communication functions</h2>
<p>The professor noted 5 communication functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Conscripting</strong> is an act that involves enlisting participation 
and eliciting reactions and comments (e.g. prototype website: Tell 
us how you like the new look!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Coordinating</strong> is expressing progress and the provisionality of 
solution states (e.g. Based on initial analysis, we have determined 
the breakdown is found in transition from proofreading to 
publication. Here is a flow-chart of the new process we propose)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Framing</strong> is establishing or reaffirming a common ground, 
typology, or constraint field (e.g. We have determined that the 
problem lies in the information used in decision making. This 
decision table details the breakdowns.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Persuading</strong> is convincing a stakeholder, often a prospective 
client that the solution fulfills project requirements (e.g. 
Running this simulation model demonstrates how we avoid bottlenecks 
at high-traffic times)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recording</strong> involves keeping a record of the solution state so 
that it can be used by others in the future (e.g. Models can 
document design decisions, templates for future development, or act 
as user documentation or training materials.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The professor noted that to avoid errors in models, you can 
proofread models just like you can proofread writing.</p>
