          <p>I'm Tim, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill at the School of Information and Library Science. This is my personal webpage. I'll post about feminism and libraries.<br/>In 2015, I completed a Master's in Women's Studies at the University of Florida. I created the Florida NOW Archive to serve as a digital companion to the physical collection held at the university.<br/>Currently, I'm learning LaTeX and writing my MSLS thesis on copyright practices in special libraries.</p>
