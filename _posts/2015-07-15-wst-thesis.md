I just submitted my Thesis Project Overview paper to the [UF Digital Collections](http://ufdc.ufl.edu). Once it's accepted, UFDC will store my paper so that anyone can read it. Kinda scary to think it's available for everyone to see, but it's too late to change it now! If you're interested in reading it but you can't access it, I've embedded the file in this post. If you have any feedback or further questions, please [send me an email](mailto:tdannecy@gmail.com) and I'd love to speak with you!
