I found an interesting poem from a woman who stepped down from her 
position as chapter president in 1973. Margaret Fifield writes to 
the members of Pensacola NOW [in a 
letter](http://flnowarchive.org/mediawiki/index.php/Box_23_Folder_1_Document_2) 
that makes me wonder what else went on in the chapter. What led her 
to write this poem?

> Some feminists are like sheep 
> They'll follow anybody 
> Just so they don't have to lead.

> Some feminists are lambs  
> Being led to the slaughter  
> Innocently.

> Some feminists are like mules  
> Plodding along through the mire  
> Hoping everything will be O.K., tomorrow.

> Some feminists are like rabbits  
> So busy hopping about that they  
> Can not (or will not) admit what's happening.

> Some feminists are like parrots  
> Talking a lot  
> But saying nothing that is new.

> Some feminists are like dogs  
> With a bone of contention  
> Until something more valuable comes along.

> Some feminists are like snakes  
> Slithering about very carefully  
> Always in control of themselves, and any situation.

> But the worst feminists of all  
> Are like poisonous snakes, destroying anyone around  
> Who doesn't watch where she's going.

> Too bad some feminists aren't more human  
> Then they could read the signs  
> That say: "Beware of Snakes:"
