I wrote this paper as a quick update to my thesis committee. At 
this point, I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work that I have 
to do to and I need to get more organized if I'm going to finish 
strong. Not only do I have to manage my time, I may have to reframe 
the scope of the project to something a bit more reasonable. If I 
had five years, I'm sure I could do the whole collection but I 
won't finish working through the entire collection in the time I 
have left in this master's. 

In any case, here's an update of my work.
