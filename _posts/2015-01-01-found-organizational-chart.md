While working through a folder on the Florida NOW archive, I found 
a sketch of a few organizational charts from several different 
organizations in [one of the 
newsletters](http://flnowarchive.org/mediawiki/index.php/Box_24_Folder_3_Document_14) 
dated 1978. I'm not sure if this is satirical or if "Arab" is 
supposed to be a joke, but I think it's interesting to see how 
these feminist organizers saw the leadership structure of the 
women's liberation movement.
