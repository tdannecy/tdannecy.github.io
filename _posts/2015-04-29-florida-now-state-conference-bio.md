I'm speaking about my project at this year's Florida NOW State Conference in a few weeks! I'm very excited about this opportunity and I can't wait to receive feedback on the site and the project as a whole!

I was asked to write a short bio and I thought I'd post it here:
> Tim D'Annecy was raised by a former pastor and graduated from a conservative Baptist high school.  
> During his first semester in college, he was introduced to feminism by Helen Strain and began volunteering with Planned Parenthood of North Florida. It was through this experience that feminism "clicked." Tim realized he wanted to learn more and went on to pursue a Master's in Women's Studies. Tim became fascinated with the history of feminism when he came across some old documents from Gainesville NOW. After finding more information about the organization in the university Special Collections, Tim created a collaborative website so that everyone could be able to access and learn from chapter newsletters and notes between activists in North Florida.  
> This past year, Tim has been working diligently on this archival project and he recently presented his website to Gainesville NOW and the community in March. In the next few years, he hopes to bring his technology skills and feminist perspective and pursue a Master's in Library and Information Science. He can be contacted at [tdannecy@ufl.edu](mailto:tdannecy@ufl.edu) and the Florida NOW website is located at http://FLNOWarchive.org/.
