My organization has been using Absorb for their LMS system and let me tell you, it's not great.

Overall, it's awful.

I've looked on other websites for a true review, but it seems like everything I've read seems to be fake reviews.
I'm tired of the sales astroturfing, so I want to get this thing out there.

Here's my opinion as someone who's been tasked with keeping training materials updated and assisting other people with using Absorb.
I'm not claiming to be a training expert, however, I'm very familiar with the training side of IT stuff. 
I've assisted about 10 people in my organization create and maintain a variety of course content.
Each person has had problems that shouldn't be problems.

First things first: 

# Absorb LMS cannot handle translations.

...at all. 
There are no ways to deal with adding a second language to existing English content.

My organization works in four languages, English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese.
After contacting Absorb support for ideas on how best to handle adding these languages, I'm seeing that they have no real plan.
Their official recommendation is to create ***separate courses for each language***. 

I hope you enjoy paying full price for an LMS stuck in the mid-2000s.

# Absorb LMS has terrible reporting.

It is nearly impossible to generate a 'report card' for an individual user.

Generating reports gives you a limited ability to see how many people (or whom) has completed each assessment.

Imagine creating four courses, one for each language, of the same content.
For this example, let's pretend there is a mandatory sexual assault course that all staff need to complete.
Okay. 
We have it all setup according to Absorb's official support.
Each course has its own quiz.
Each quiz has its own report.
There's no way to generate one report for all of these courses.
The content creators I was supporting were forced to manually export each report to a CSV, then collate everything in an Excel spreadsheet.
This makes any kind of compliance reporting a nightmare.
The auditor won't accept a handmade Excel spreadsheet and requires a document from the LMS.

Absorb can't combine reports and it makes mandatory courses a nightmare.

# Absorb LMS cannot handle HR documents for onboarding.

There are no ways to hook in E-Verify or have digital I9 forms.
There are no ways to use electronic signatures.
There are no ways for users to use electronic forms.

Allowing users to upload documents inside a course is a headache to retrieve later on.
There

# Absorb LMS has no support for external services.

After users upload documents, there's no way to automatically transfer these files to another service.
There is no support for webhooks.
If you want to run a submitted document through a plaigarism checker (for example), you would need to manually download the file and re-upload it to whatever service you're using.

# Absorb LMS has no real support for Azure SSO.

# Absorb LMS cannot support long-term courses.

# Absorb LMS has a terrible admin interface.

Every generated list has a default maximum of only 20 entries displayed.
This creates a series of pages that you must flip through or change the displayed entry option.

Also, whatever number you want to display in the list will revert back to 20 if you reload the page.

Paginated navigation? 
In 2020?

20 maximum rows displayed at once? 

# Absorb LMS has weak field 

# Absorb LMS has broken javascript.

You'll feel this one whenever you navigate to a new page.
Even refreshing the page will take about 5 seconds for it to render.

# Absorb LMS has a bad user experience.

So great, we have the content uploaded and things seem to be working correctly.
Let's tell the users to access the site and take a course.

# Absorb LMS has no support for custom URLs

We were forced to use shortened URLs for any link to make sense.
The only links that are generated by the system are **36 character** hashes.
It's not pretty emailing out a link that looks like 5a27e388-8cb4-46e1-9e1c-f4fb6a69bd2a and there's no way to change a course URL once they're created.
There's no support for short links and we were forced to use (and pay for) a third party URL shortener to 

# Absorb LMS has no real analytics.

How many people clicked on your course link?
What's the conversion rate between clicks and enrollments?
Who started the course and didn't complete?
How long are people watching the video content?
