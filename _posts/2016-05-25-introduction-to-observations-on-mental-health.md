> Today, more than 50 years after the October 1917 revolution, 
> Soviet life reflects a mixture of ageless Russian culture, 
> evolving Marxist ideology and the dynamics of modern technology. 
> The most significant aspect of Soviet life is that it is planned, 
> with central direction residing in the state. There is 
> considerable pressure toward conformity, toward behaving in a 
> socially and politically acceptable fashion. There is a relative 
> de-emphasis of personal needs in favor of the primacy of the 
> collective to which the individual is expected to yield.


> From birth through nursery school and all the school grades and 
> Communist Party youth organizations, the Soviet child is reared 
> to function as a member of the collective. Personality 
> development and behavior change are achieved through group 
> rewards and punishments. Individual achievements are considered 
> in terms of their value to the collective. Membership in a 
> collective provides identification, a sense of personal 
> well-being, and satisfaction of material and emotional needs. It 
> serves to socialize the Soviet child and to strengthen early 
> acceptance of the values of adult society.


> The concept of the collective also dominates university life. 
> Both undergraduate and graduate students are fully aware that 
> they receive a very expensive state-subsidized education, plus 
> cost-of-living stipends. There seems to be an understanding that 
> this education is provided because the larger collective--the 
> people of the Soviets--need the student's talents and the 
> resulting contribution he is expected to make. This is in concert 
> with the Soviet attitude that every citizen, whether male or 
> female, should contribute to society which, in turn, will meet 
> his need for social security. One Soviet colleague put it this 
> way, "I don't have to save for a rainy day. I know I will always 
> have a job or a pension. Medical care is free and our children 
> will be educated without any cost to us".
