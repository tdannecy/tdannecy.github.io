I came across an interesting quote [in a newsletter from 
2000](http://flnowarchive.org/mediawiki/index.php/Box_28_Folder_10_Document_20) 
by a member of the University of Florida campus NOW chapter during 
a reelection campaign:

> Feminism doesn't mean "be nice," I would like more open debate. 
> All these appeals to sisterhood-just because you don't agree with 
> somebody doesn't mean you don't like the person. It's a thing 
> that we need to work out. "Be nice" - I don't like that idea. We 
> want to be a united front but we also don't want to crush each 
> other with everyone trying to be nice to everybody.
