I came across a funny comic in [one of the newsletters](http://flnowarchive.org/mediawiki/index.php/Box_24_Folder_3_Document_30) from Tallahassee NOW dated February 1980. Thought I'd share it.

> Left: So the doctor says to me, "Why not have your uterus removed; You're not using it, and it'll save you a lot of trouble in the long run."

> Right: If a man had a uterus, it would be like a landmark building, you'd need a court order to remove it.
