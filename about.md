I'm Tim, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina - 
Chapel Hill at the School of Information and Library Science. This is my personal webpage. I'll post about feminism and libraries.

In 2015, I completed a Master's in Women's Studies at the 
University of Florida. I created the Florida NOW Archive to serve 
as a digital companion to the physical collection held at the university.

Currently, I'm learning LaTeX and writing my MSLS thesis on 
copyright practices in special libraries.
