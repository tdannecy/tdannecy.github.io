I'm Tim, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill at the School of Information and Library Science. This is my 
personal webpage. I'll post about feminism, techy stuff, and libraries.

In 2015, I completed a Master's in Women's Studies at the University of Florida. I created the Florida NOW Archive to serve as a digital 
companion to the physical collection held at the university. You can read about the project [here](/2015/07/15/wst-thesis.html). 

Currently, I'm learning LaTeX and writing my MSLS thesis about copyright practices in special libraries. 

If you want to know more about me, [view my resume](/resume.pdf) or [send me an email](mailto:tdannecy@gmail.com).
